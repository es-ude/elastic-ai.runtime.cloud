=== Types of Communication Endpoints

Services::
Services are the interface external users would use.
Inside a service, any given functionality can be implemented e.g. a service called 'WristService' could implement necessary functionalities for a that specific use case, like storing g-values.

Monitor::
The monitor has a wildcard to the status of all participants, meaning the monitor is subscribed to the status of every device.
Therefore, it is used to check which devices are available for communication.
Furthermore, it can implement device specific functionalities e.g. flashing bit files.
